# Project Ideas

Here are my 3 project ideas for sfdat26:

## Idea #1: Predicting likelihood of sale

- I want to build a model to predict the likelihood that a given prospect in my company's Salesforce account will end up buying our services.
- I will use our historic Salesforce data - over 1.6M rows - to do this. The idea is to identify a few features in Salesforce that most strongly correlate with a prospect buying our service and building a predictive model.
- Main issue here will be data quality; all our Salesforce data is entered manually by sales reps, lots of duplicate accounts, etc.

## Idea #2: Predicting account profitability
- I want to build a model to predict the profitability of a given customer based on the data we know about them when they sign up to buy our services.
- I have access to historical profitability (and loss) data for each customer, along with churn data. 
- There's a data quality issue with the profitability data so I may end up just narrowing the scope to predicting churn/customer lifetime.

## Idea #3: Predicting water usage
- I want to build a model to predict residential water usage in San Francisco. 
- I have access to historical residential water usage data, as well as the factors that (based on my limited research) correlate with residential water usage: population, population density, and weather/temperature.
- My limited domain expertise in this area makes the project challenging, but it's an area I'm interested in.
